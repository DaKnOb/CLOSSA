<h3>The CLOSSA Compiler</h3>
CLOSSA, or in Greek "CΛΩΣΣΑ" is a C-based language suitable for teaching high school students programming. It is designed to replace the current "ΓΛΩΣΣΑ" being taught by adding more power yet maintaining a Greek enviroment for the students to work on. It is not type-safe like ΓΛΩΣΣΑ but adds way more capabilities to the hands of the developers. Although it is not yet documented, we are working on making this compiler work and documentation will follow afterwards. It is obviously not a trolling attempt. The language supports integers, doubles, longs, characters -all signed or unsigned, structs and even external libraries.

<h4>Caveats:</h4>
Currently all strings used must be in English, as well as all variable and function names.
